# Python Groups Hands-on

## Project: Library Management System

### Description
This project involves developing a basic **Library Management System (LMS)** that allows users to manage book records efficiently. The system supports adding, updating, deleting, and displaying book information while also providing basic statistical analysis.

### Features

#### 1. Data Structure Design
- Utilizes **lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets** to store book records, including:
  - `Book ID`
  - `Title`
  - `Author`
  - `Publication Year`
  - `Genres`

#### 2. Basic Operations
- Functions to:
  - **Add** a new book.
  - **Update** existing book details.
  - **Delete** a book record.
  - **Display** all stored books in an organized format.
- Implements input validation and type conversion for data integrity.

#### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Functions to compute:
  - **Total number of books** in the system.
  - **Average publication year** of all books.
  - **Most common genre** among the books.


#### 4. Advanced Features
- **Search functionality**:
  - Find books by `Title` or `Author` using **list comprehensions**.
  - Implements **case-insensitive searches** for better user experience.
- **Data Filtering**:
  - Extracts books that belong to a particular genre.
